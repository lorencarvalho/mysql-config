# InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and
# row data. The bigger you set this the less disk I/O is needed to
# access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may
# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you
# might be limited to 2-3.5G of user level memory per process, so do not
# set it too high.

# InnoDB stores data in one or more data files forming the tablespace.
# If you have a single logical drive for your data, a single
# autoextending file would be good enough. In other cases, a single file
# per device is often a good choice. You can configure InnoDB to use raw
# disk partitions as well - please refer to the manual for more info
# about this.

# The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as

# once per second anyway, it does not make sense to have it very large
# (even with long transactions).
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M

# Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size
# of log files to about 25%-100% of your buffer pool size to avoid

# How long an InnoDB transaction should wait for a lock to be granted
# before being rolled back. InnoDB automatically detects transaction
# deadlocks in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you
# use the LOCK TABLES command, or other transaction-safe storage engines
# than InnoDB in the same transaction, then a deadlock may arise which
# InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like this the timeout is useful to
# resolve the situation.doing
