# back_log is the number of connections the operating system can keep in

# The size of the cache to hold the SQL statements for the binary log
# during a transaction. If you often use big, multi-statement
# transactions you can increase this value to get more performance. All

# How many threads we should keep in a cache for reuse. When a client
# disconnects, the client's threads are put in the cache if there aren't

# Query cache is used to cache SELECT results and later return them

# system.

# The directory used by MySQL for storing temporary files. For example,
# it is used to perform disk based large sorts, as well as for internal
# and explicit temporary tables. It might be good to put it on a
# swapfs/tmpfs filesystem, if you do not create very large temporary
# files. Alternatively you can put it on dedicated disk. You can
# specify multiple paths here by separating them by ";" - they will then
# be used in a round-robin fashion.

# If you are using this option with the slow query log enabled, queries
# that are expected to retrieve all rows are logged. This option does not
# necessarily mean that no index is used. For example, a query that uses a
# full index scan uses an index but would be logged because the index would
# not limit the number of rows.
